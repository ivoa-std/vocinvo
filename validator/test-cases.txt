* "each vocabulary must be clearly identified as \emph{either} giving
  SKOS concepts" -- that's a simple condition on ivoasem:vocflavour
* "The reverse property, \vocterm{skos:narrower}, MAY be given, but
  clients MUST NOT depend on their presence" -- not validatable

[SKOS]

* "all concepts MUST have an English-language preferred label" --
  "English-language" will probably not be reasonably validatable, "a
  non-empty string" is easy.
* "all concepts MUST have a non-trivial English-language definition"
  -- again, "non-empty" would work.  There is a problem with the UAT
  here, because they still don't have proper descriptions for the
  majority of their concepts, and they certainly won't be complete
  for many years.  Let's see if I live with regular errors on that.

[RDF property]

* as for SKOS
* "term MUST NOT appear as subject of more than one
  \vocterm{rdfs:subPropertyOf} triple" -- that's an interesting one,
  as it's trivial to validate in Desise, so if we trust the Desise
  tooling, that would be done.  With a bit more work, we could
  validate this from the RDF artefacts.  Can't say whether I'll do
  that.

[RDF class]

* as for RDF Property

[General]

* "IVOA vocabularies MUST include exactly one triple with the
  vocabulary as subject and a predicate \vocterm{dc:created}" --
  straightforward, with the caveat on desise.
* "IVOA vocabularies MUST include exactly one triple with the
  vocabulary as subject and a string literal specifying the kind of
  vocabulary as per this specification." -- as mentioned above.
* "\vocterm{ivoasem:useInstead} [...] This property MUST NOT be
  used with non-deprecated subjects." -- ah, that one could
  definitely go wrong at the moment.
* "The rationale MUST discuss the reasons for a deprecation." -- not
  validatable.
* "...he VEP in question must be withdrawn..." -- not validatable
* "Each term in the IVOA vocabulary mirror MUST declare its identity to
  the original, external RDF resource." -- tricky; since the spec
  does not, I think, forbid extra terms on the IVOA end and I'm not
  sure I'd like to outlaw that before I understand just why I should
  do that, I can't just blindly raise an error if there's a concept
  in an externally managed vocabulary that has no skos:exactMatch.
  The reason for the MUST here is to enable external tools knowing
  about the upstream vocabulary to work with our vocabularies.  It's
  not entriely clear that's something that will actually happen (even
  though we're using it as a selling point).  I'd for now look the
  other way.
* "Externally managed vocabularies must use the SKOS flavour." --
  that's a technicality, and to validate it, I'd have to have a list
  of externally managed vocabularies.  That's not hard to do (this
  list has one element at this point, and I'd be surprised if it had
  more than five entries by 2030), but given the complications of the
  adoption process there's no plausible way this could break.
* "[versioned] URIs, however, MUST NOT be used externally" -- not
  validatable.
