The source of the 2.0 version of Vocabularies in the VO.  Formatted
versions are found at the IVOA document repository at
http://ivoa.net/documents.

Historians may be happy to know that sources for Version 1 still exist,
but 2.0 really is a new document, they are not in its history.  See
https://volute.g-vo.org/svn/trunk/projects/semantics/attic/.
