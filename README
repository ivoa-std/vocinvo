The source of the 2.0 version of Vocabularies in the VO.  Version 1
was moved to semantics/attic for now because no meaningful diff exists
but it's still the current norm.  Remove it when this version 2 goes to
REC.

This also contains some code to validate and parse vocabularies.  To
validate all semantics-managed vocabuaries, check out

https://volute.g-vo.org/svn/trunk/projects/semantics

and then say:

$ cd voc_source
$ python convert.py ALL
$ cd ../Vocabularies
$ find .. -name "*.rdf" | xargs python3 revovo.py
