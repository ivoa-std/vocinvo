This is some experimental code for a bridge between the UAT and IVOA
vocabularies.  If adopted, it quite certainly will not stay here.

The basic interest is:

* have IVOA-compatible URIs for UAT concepts; most importantly, we want
  readable concept URIs (BlackHole rather than 120)
* maintain format guarantees (have simple XML, have turtle)
